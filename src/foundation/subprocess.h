/*
 * subprocess.h — spawn a child process, supervise it, and classify how it ended.
 *
 * Generalized from the crash-isolating index spawn in src/ui/http_server.c so the
 * crash/hang supervisor (Track C) can reuse one primitive across platforms.
 *
 * Beyond a plain spawn+wait it adds the two things a supervisor needs and the
 * ad-hoc harness lacked:
 *   1. Exit CLASSIFICATION — {clean, exit-nonzero, crash, hang, killed} — from
 *      POSIX WIFSIGNALED/WTERMSIG and the Windows NTSTATUS exception exit codes
 *      (0xC0000005 access-violation, 0xC00000FD stack-overflow, …).
 *   2. A quiet-timeout — kill + report HANG when the child makes no progress
 *      (emits no new log line) for a configurable window. This catches external
 *      tree-sitter scanners that infinite-loop (a hang, not a crash).
 *
 * The reap loop is EINTR-safe. Line tailing keeps a partial final line buffered
 * while the child tree can still write, then delivers that final fragment once
 * the tree is quiescent.
