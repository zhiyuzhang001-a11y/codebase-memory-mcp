/*
 * index_supervisor.h — run index_repository in a supervised worker subprocess.
 *
 * A single pathological file can hard-crash (SIGSEGV / stack overflow / abort) or
 * hang the native indexer, and today that takes down the whole MCP server or CLI.
 * The supervisor runs the actual index in a CHILD process (the same binary
 * re-invoked with a build-bound `cli --index-worker …` grammar), reaps it, and
 * classifies how it ended. A crash/hang is contained to the child; the parent
 * survives and reports it instead of dying.
 *
 * This module owns only the spawn/reap MECHANISM and the worker-role state. The
 * MCP handler (mcp.c) owns the gate placement and the response building, so this
 * module has no dependency on the response format.
 *
 * fork+exec only (never fork-and-run-in-child): the server holds persistent
 * threads plus mimalloc/sqlite global state with no pthread_atfork, so a
 * fork without exec would be a latent deadlock. Recursion is prevented by an argv
 * flag (`--index-worker`), never an ambient env var.
